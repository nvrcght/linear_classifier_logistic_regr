# linear_classifier_logistic_regr

Exploring logistic regression and feature engineering with existing scikit learn functions.

Using product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative. 


-training a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews;  
-inspecting the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model;  
-making a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review;  
-given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, writing a function to compute the accuracy of the model;  
-inspecting the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpreting their meanings;  
-comparing multiple logistic regression models
